# cky-parser
Implementation of the probabilistic CKY parsing algorithm. 


The probabilistic CKY parsing algorithm was implemented based on materials in section 13.2 of Speech and Languange Processing (3rd edition draft) by Daniel Jurafsky and James Martin. This project was based off of an assignment posted on the following website:
https://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang/teaching/nlp/2016/hw4.html

The only file written by me is cky_parser.py, all other files are from the assignment. Data is origninally from the Air Traffic Information System in the Penn Treebank.
